    <p>
        Beef burgers are the tried and true version of the “hamburger”. Beef hamburgers are made with ground beef. There are a few different types of ground beef that can be used to make burgers, and each will have a slightly different flavor profile. 

Ground beef can be divided into traditional ground beef, ground round, ground sirloin and lean ground beef. Traditional ground beef contains between 25 and 30% fat (typically closer to %30) and is a great full flavored option when it comes to making burgers. The best burger joints in the country, according to Hamburger America, use ground chuck to make their hamburgers. This type of meat comes in at 80/20 or 70/30 and makes a delicious burger if you do not have any health restrictions. Ground round contains about 15% fat and comes from the rear of the cow towards the tail. The meat can be slightly tougher but will also be a bit more expensive because of the lack of fat. Ground sirloin has a fat content between 10% and 14%. This meat comes from the mid section of the cow and is a good choice for those looking for a lower fat option. Last, but not least (especially in price), is lean ground beef which contains less than 10% fat. Lean ground beef can be difficult to make burgers with because it will dry out very quickly. For this reason, we like to add other ingredients to our lean ground beef patties such as cheese, spinach and garlic;
